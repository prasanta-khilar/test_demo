throwable:
You can use it in a catch clause, but you should never do it! If you use Throwable in a catch clause, it will not only catch all exceptions; it will also catch all errors. Errors are thrown by the JVM to indicate serious problems that are not intended to be handled by an application.

right:
  try{
            int s = 1/0;
            System.out.println("try block");
        }catch(Exception ex){
            System.out.println("exception");
        }catch(Throwable e){
            System.out.println("catch throwable");
        }
		
Wrong:
		  try{
            int s = 1/0;
            System.out.println("try block");
        }catch(Throwable e){
            System.out.println("catch throwable");
        }catch(Exception ex){
            System.out.println("exception");
        }
